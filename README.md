# ImageAssist
A simple browser-based image viewer tool for our clinics.

Our clinics have had issues for some time with convenient image viewing for our diagnostic studies.  
While we were reluctant to add full browser-based systems that contained patient data, the tool itself
was well within our capabilities.  This system will provide a convenient tool for viewing images and
clips from our studies that are stored locally at the clinic.  This should prevent unnecessary risk
to patient data.

The initial build is functional at this time, but our team will review over the next month to 
assess improvements that could be made to the appearance and overall user experience.
